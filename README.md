# RPS-recognition
CS@SIT AI Project2018

### Must be dark bg (Ex. blue, black, green)
### This project based on Anaconda

- Using Keras tf backend for image classification with CNN
- Training done on jupyter notebook file
- evaluate is the output of prediction
- capture_play is the real-time prediction
- capture_train use for snapping train images
- The model we use is myModel04.h5

Feel free to use this noob ML
